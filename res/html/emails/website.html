            <h2>SenateTrades: Website Launch & Weekly Digest</h2>
            We're excited to announce the launch of our new website, <a href="https://anderseline.github.io/senatetrades.io/">SenateTrades.io</a> - check it out!
            <i>Boy, that would look good in your bookmarks bar.</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            Here you can find all of our resources under one roof - trade alerts are cataloged on the main page, each with the same level of detail 
            you expect in our email alerts. You can also find an about page for more in-depth information on the service, as well as links to our Twitter, Data
            Dashboard, and Community Forms.
        </p>
        <p>
            We've also been listening to your feedback, and have been working on creating a weekly digest series. These emails would focus on distilling more
            general trading information and patterns coming from the Capitol Building over that week, providing links to relevant news articles, and informing users 
            of how stocks have performed that week against the market. 
        </p>

            Keep your eyes out for more updates to come!<br>
