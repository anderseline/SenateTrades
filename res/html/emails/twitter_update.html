            <h2>We now have a Twitter!</h2>
            To reach a wider audience, I've created a bot which posts short snippets of each alert to twitter whenever one goes out. These 
            are much shorter than the usual email alerts due to Twitter's character limits, but suppliment the service. Email alerts will remain 
            unchanged.
