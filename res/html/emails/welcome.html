                <h2>Welcome to SenateTrades!</h2>
                Your email has now been added to the mailing list. You can expect alerts a few times per month,
                but this is subject to change with trading activity. Make sure to check out our
                <a href="https://anderseline.github.io/senatetrades.io/">Website</a> for a list of all previous trades,
                more data, and community resources.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the meantime, follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/Senate_Trades">Twitter</a> and check out our 
                <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zSpyfOWCuUkW4yzCh-PnHx5Qv_WWFb3AsMnoXUjr8qk/edit#gid=0">Dashboard</a> 
                to see a history or how previous trades have performed. You should also visit the 
                <a href="https://www.senate.gov/senators/senators-contact.htm">senator contact information page</a> to let officials
                know your thoughts on their stock trading activity.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each trade sends out its own email so it is possible you may get multiple emails at once, as occasionally senators will file
                all trades made recently on a single day.<b> Most importantly, this is in no way investment advice. </b>I do not suggest naively buying
                any stock which this program discovers. It is important to do your own due-diligence and research before making any decisions. The 
                intention of this program is to help spur ideas for future investments, and to help you stay informed. More in-depth information 
                on the project can be found <a href='https://anderseline.github.io/senatetrades.io/about/'>here</a>.
